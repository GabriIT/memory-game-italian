Explanation:

Import Statements:

React, { useState, useEffect }: Imports necessary hooks from React.
decode: Imports the decode function from html-entities to decode HTML entities.
./MemoryGame.css: Imports the CSS file for styling.
State Variables:

cards: Stores the array of card objects.
flippedCards: Stores the IDs of the currently flipped cards.
matchedCards: Stores the IDs of the matched cards.
gameOver: Boolean to indicate if the game is over.
useEffect Hook (Data Fetching):

Fetches data from vocIT.json when the component mounts.
Selects 5 random pairs of animals from the fetched data.
Creates an array of card objects, each with an id, type (picture or word), content (emoji or word), name (animal name), and matched (boolean).
Shuffles the cards array using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.
Updates the cards state with the shuffled cards.
handleCardClick Function:

Handles clicks on the cards.
If two cards are already flipped, the card is already matched, or the card is already flipped, it ignores the click.
Adds the clicked card's ID to the flippedCards array.
If one card is already flipped, it checks if the current card matches the first flipped card.
If they match, it adds both card IDs to matchedCards and clears flippedCards.
If they don't match, it clears flippedCards after a 1-second delay.
useEffect Hook (Game Over Check):

Checks if all cards are matched. If so, it sets gameOver to true.
JSX Structure:

Renders a div with the class memory-game to wrap the game.
Renders a heading h2 for the game title.
Renders a div with the class cards-container to hold the cards.
Maps over the cards array and renders a div with the class card for each card.
The card div has a dynamic class that adds flipped if the card is flipped or matched if the card is matched.
The card div has an onClick handler that calls handleCardClick when clicked.
Inside each card, there is a card-inner div that handles the flip animation.
The card-front div is the back of the card, and the card-back div is the front of the card, showing the content.
Renders a div with the class game-over if the game is over.
CSS Styling:

Basic styling for the game container, cards, and flip animation.
The card-inner div uses transform-style: preserve-3d to enable 3D transformations.
The card-front and card-back divs use backface-visibility: hidden to hide the back face of the card.
The flipped class rotates the card-inner div by 180 degrees on the Y-axis to show the back of the card.
The matched class keeps the card flipped.
